Get the PSN API keys: First, you'll need to obtain the PSN API keys. You can do this by creating a developer account on the Sony Developer Network and registering your application. Once you've registered, you'll receive a client ID and client secret, which you'll use to authenticate your API requests.

Install required libraries: You'll need to install the requests and json libraries for Python. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:
##
pip install requests

pip install json
##
Download the spoofer script in releases.

Run the script in the zip file: Download the ZIP file and run it using Python:
python psn_spoofer.py

This will send a request to the PSN API to spoof the level and trophy data for the specified user.

By following these steps, you'll have a PSN level and trophy temp/perm spoofer using the PSN API and Python. This script will send a request to the PSN API to spoof the level and trophy data for the specified user, making it appear as if they have achieved the specified level and earned the specified trophy.

(In this script, replace your_client_id, your_client_secret, your_username, your_password, your_level_id, your_level_name, your_level_description, your_level_icon_url, your_trophy_id, your_trophy_name, your_trophy_description, and your_trophy_icon_url with your actual PSN API keys and the level and trophy data you want to spoof.)

## Commands

python psnspoof.py 
--action (trophy, percentage, level) 
--type (temp, perm)
